abstract: |
  The trade module is divided in two submodules: `complete_tf_cpc`
  and `total_trade_CPC`. The `complete_tf_cpc` module uses the
  most disaggregated bilateral transactions between countries
  (obtained from Eurostat for European countries, and from UNSD
  for the remaining countries), filters the agriculture-related
  flows of interest for the Organisation, standardises units of
  measurement, maps item and country codes to a standard set of
  codes, imputes missing quantities, and computes unit values. The
  `total_trade_CPC` aggregates bilateral trade (i.e., the results
  of `complete_tf_cpc`) at reporter level. Each module is year
  specific, i.e, the trade modules run independently for each year
  (not necessarily in a chronological order). To run the
  `total_trade_CPC` module, the output of the `complete_tf_cpc`
  module is required. Data is validated with complimentary tools
  that detect outliers and allows analysts to correct flows in an
  informed way. In this document, an overall narrative of
  what the modules do is presented. A detailed step-by-step
  illustration of the modules/tools is given in separate documents.

## Data

Raw data are harvested and provided by the SWS Team (subunit of
Team F) for both UNSD Tariff line and Eurostat Data. The dataset
is prefiltered by downloading only chapters of interest, which
are:

  01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 43, 50, 51, 52, 53.

In the following table, an example of filtered UNSD data is shown
(variable names have been modified). It contains information on
the reporter, partner, flow (1 = imports; 2 = exports; 3 =
re-exports; 4 = re-imports), HS codes (variable length), monetary
value (in USD dollars), weight (in kilograms), supplementary
quantity, the unit in which the supplementary quantity is given
(`qunit`, e.g., 8 = kilograms, 7 = liters), and the chapter.

```{r}
knitr::kable(examples$tldata_raw, row.names = FALSE, caption =
'Subset of Tariff line data', digits = 2)
```

In the following table, an example on filtered Eurostat data is
reported (also in this case, the original variable names were
modified). The main differences are: reporter and partner codes
are "geonomenclature" codes (in UNSD they are "M49"); the HS
length is maximum 8-digits; monetary values are in thousands of
euros; weight is reported in tonnes; the supplementary quantity is
always commodity specific (in Tariff line data it can happen that
the same HS code is reported in different units).


```{r}
knitr::kable(examples$esdata_raw, row.names = FALSE, caption =
'Subset of Eurostat data', digits = 2)
```

Besides filtering by chapters, only some HS codes inside the
chapters are considered. These codes are given in the
`hs6faointerest` datatable, of which the next table shows a
subset:

```{r}
# If a single column, the caption is not shown and next table
# has a n+1 number. Bug?
knitr::kable(dplyr::mutate(examples$hs6faointerest, ` ` = ''),
row.names = FALSE, caption = 'HS-6 codes of interest')
```

As seen before, both Eurostat and Tariff line data are given the
same variable names and data types before being processed further.

### Eurostat

- only `stat_regime` equal to 4 is kept.

  > In this system *["Statistical regime 4" or "Total trade"]*, the
  > recorded aggregates include all goods entering or leaving the
  > economic territory of a country with the exception of simple
  > transit trade. In particular, all goods received into customs
  > warehouses are recorded as imports, regardless of whether they
  > subsequently go into free circulation in the Member State of
  > receipt. Similarly, outgoing goods from customs warehouses are
  > included in the general trade aggregates, at the time they
  > leave the Member State.

  See pag. 9 in *DG Trade Statistical Guide*, June 2016,
  http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/may/tradoc_151348.pdf

- only numeric codes of reporters and partners are kept (letters
  are not allowed; basically this removes the "EU" total).

- only numeric CN8 codes (`hs`) are kept (letters are not
  allowed; in the example it is possible to see a non numeric HS:
  it will be removed).

### UNSD

- only numeric HS (`hs`) codes are kept (letters are not
  allowed).

## Process

### Aggregate UNSD Tariff line individual Shipments

The tariffline data from UNSD contains multiple rows with
identical combination of `reporter` / `partner` / `commodity` /
`flow` / `year` / `qunit`. Those are transactions registered
separately, thus rows containing non-missing values and
quantities can be aggregated.  Missing variables of the same type
are also aggregated if they are *all* missing, as they will
produce a missing aggregated value for missing disaggregated
values while correctly summing the remaining variables.

```{r}
knitr::kable(examples$tldata_multiple, row.names = FALSE,
caption = 'Example of multiple transactions by
`reporter` / `partner` / `flow` / `year` / `hs`')
```

The results of the aggregation of the previous example are shown
in  the following table. In this case, even if there is a unique
combination of `reporter` / `partner` / `flow` / `year` / `hs`,
the rows are two: indeed, one reports the aggregated transactions
where the `weight` variable was available, and the other reports
the aggregated cases where it was missing.

```{r}
knitr::kable(examples$tldata_multiple_aggregated, row.names = FALSE,
caption = 'Results of the aggregation of multiple transactions')
```

After quantity conversions are made, or missing quantities get
imputed (see further), the two different rows in the previous
table will be aggregated into a single transaction.

### Mapping UNSD Tariff line and Eurostat data

At this stage a standardization/mapping step is performed. The
details are divided between UNSD Tariff line and Eurostat due to
the nature of the differences among the two datasets.

#### UNSD Tariff line {-}

1. UNSD Tariff line data reports area code with Tariff line M49
   standard codes (which are different from official M49). The area
   code is converted in FAO country code using a specific
   conversion table provided by Team ENV.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$m49faomap, row.names = FALSE,
   caption = 'Subset of the M49 to FAO codes mapping table')
   ```

1. Countries that are not supposed to exist in the year for which
   the module runs are removed from the data (e.g., Serbia did not
   exist as a single official country before 2006).

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$reporters_start_end_date, row.names = FALSE,
   caption = 'Subset of the tables with countries and their
   `startDate` and `endDate`')
   ```

1. European countries (as reporters) already in Eurostat data are
   removed.

1. Area codes not mapping to any FAO country code are removed and
   will be mirrored in a later step. All countries mapping to code
   252 (which corresponds to undefined areas) are mapped to the 896
   M49 code ("Other nei").

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$unmapped_countries, row.names = FALSE,
   caption = 'Example of unmapped countries')
   ```

1. The flow codes of re-Import (code 4) are recoded into Import
   (code 1) and codes of re-Export (code 3) to Export (code 2).
   This procedure is applied following UNSD standards:

   > Exports of a country can be distinguished as exports of
   > domestic goods and exports of foreign goods. The second class
   > is generally referred to as re-exports. The exports shown in
   > our database contain both the exports of domestic and foreign
   > goods. Re-exports are exports of foreign goods in the same
   > state as previously imported; they are to be included in the
   > country exports. It is recommended that they be recorded
   > separately for analytical purposes. This may require the use
   > of supplementary sources of information in order to determine
   > the origin of re-exports, i.e., to determine that the goods
   > in question are indeed re-exports rather than the export of
   > goods that have acquired domestic origin through processing.
   > Re-imports are goods imported in the same state as previously
   > exported. They are included in the country imports. It is
   > recommended that they be recorded separately for analytical
   > purposes. This may require the use of supplementary sources
   > of information in order to determine the origin of
   > re-imports, i.e., to determine that the goods in question are
   > indeed re-imports rather than the import of goods that have
   > acquired foreign origin through processing. There are several
   > reasons why an exported good might return to the country of
   > origin. The exported good might be defective, the importer
   > might have defaulted on payments or cancelled the order, the
   > authorities might have imposed an import barrier, or demand
   > or prices in the country of origin might have made it
   > worthwhile to bring the good back.

   See:
   http://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/Reexports-and-Reimports

1. Set all HS codes to the maximum length (by reporter / flow)
   found in the HS-FCL mapping table valid for the reporter in
   that year (see below).

1. Commodity codes are reported in HS codes (*Harmonized Commodity
   Description and Coding System*). The codes are converted in FCL
   (*FAO Commodity List*) codes. This step is performed using a
   table incorporated in the SWS that was built starting from the
   MDB files used in the previous system (known as
   *Shark/Jellyfish*). In this step, all the mapping between HS
   and FCL code is stored. If a country is not included in the
   mapping table for that specific year, all the records
   for the reporting country are removed. All records without an
   FCL mapping are filtered out and saved in specific variables.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$hsfclmap[ ,c('area', 'flow', 'fromcode',
   'tocode', 'fcl', 'startyear', 'endyear')], row.names = FALSE,
   caption = 'Subset of the HS to FCL mapping table')
   ```
   
   Some codes can be unmapped in the previous table, i.e., no FCL
   code can be assigned to some HS codes. In this case, the
   module generates a list of these codes that is sent to Team B/C
   so that they can update the table by including these missing
   codes.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(dplyr::select(examples$hsfclmap_additions,
   -tl_description, -mapped_by,-hs_extend, -hs_chap, -reporter_name),
   row.names = FALSE, caption = 'Subset of additions to the HS to FCL
   mapping table')
   ```

   Moreover, some of the original codes in the HS-FCL
   mapping can be better mapped to another FCL code: the mapping
   table has a `correction_fcl` (not shown in the previous
   example in order to save space) that can be used to override
   the original `fcl` variable. This feature was requested by Team
   B/C that is responsible for these corrections.

1. Information of the FCL units is added, i.e, to each FCL code
   its final unit of measurement is assigned.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$fclunits, row.names = FALSE, caption =
   'Subset of FCL units')
   ```

1. Data conversion of units of measurements are applied to meet
   FAO standards, where all weights are reported in tonnes,
   animals in heads or 1000 heads and, for some commodities, just
   the value is provided. For example, if the originally-reported
   quantity is "units" and the FAO unit is "1000 heads", the
   quantity is divided by 1000.

1. Non-livestock commodity specific conversions are added. This is
   done by taking the ratio of the reported weight and quantity
   (divided by 1000), computing the median of this ratio by FCL and
   the originally reported unit of measurement, and finally
   multiplying it by the reported quantity. To make this clear an
   example could be useful: suppose that a country does not report
   the weight of eggs, but reports units, in this case, we compute
   the median of the weight/quantity/1000 ratio for all countries
   where both weight and quantity are reported and then apply this
   median in order to have an idea of how many tonnes the reported
   quantities of that country weighs. [Probably a weak point of
   this procedure is that not in all countries eggs weigh the
   same, thus a more realistic approach would be to compute
   regional medians (e.g., for Thailand use the Asian median of
   the weight/quantity/1000 ratio). The first-best approach, in
   any case, would be to have speficic tables derived from
   external sources. This is currently under investigation.] This
   procedure is not applied to livestock: in this case, a country/item
   specific datatable exists where weights of livestock are present.

#### Eurostat {-}

1. Eurostat classifies areas in their "geonomenclature". These
   codes are converted in FAO country codes using a specific
   conversion table, stored in the SWS, provided by Team B/C.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$geonom, row.names = FALSE, caption =
   'Subset of geonom (Eurostat) to FAO codes mapping')
   ```

   Area codes not mapping to any FAO country code are reported and
   the records for these area codes are removed. All countries
   mapping to code 252 (which corresponds to undefined areas) are
   mapped to the 896 M49 code ("Other nei").

1. Commodity codes are reported in CN8 codes (*Combined
   Nomenclature 8 digits*). The codes are converted in FCL (*FAO
   Commodity List*) codes. This step is performed using the same
   HS to FCL mapping table as for UNSD Tariff line. If a specific
   record has a CN8 code not mapping to any specific FCL code,
   then it is stored, sent to Team B/C for mapping and
   re-incorporated after the link has been updated. If a country
   is not included in the mapping table for that specific year,
   all the records for the reporting country are removed, and will
   be mirrored in a subsequent step.
   
1. Information of the FCL units is added. This step is
   straightforward since for Eurostat the units are for the vast
   majority the same as FAO units.

1. Some commodity specific conversions are needed as Eurostat
   reports the figures in a different unit with respect to FAO.
   With respect to UNSD data, this is only needed for few
   commodities, namely: 1057, 1068, 1072, 1079, 1083, 1140, 1181.

1. Values are converted from EUR to USD using a table, stored in
   the SWS, with the official EUR/USD exchange rate for each year
   provided by Team B/C.

   ```{r}
   knitr::kable(examples$eurusd, row.names = FALSE, caption =
   'EUR/USD exchange rates')
   ```

### Pre-processing reports

The module generates various indicators/statistics on the raw data
that are combined into different pre-processing reports (PPRs). The
following PPRs are available in the "trade-reports" SWS domain:

1. Reporters by year
1. Non-reporting countries
1. Number of records by reporter/year
1. Missing data by report
1. Check qty and value included
1. Import and export content check

For a detailed explanation of what the PPR contain and how to
update them, see the document "Trade Module: Plug-in
Pre-Processing Report". Note that these tables are *not*
saved automatically to SWS, but need to be uploaded by using
the `pre_processing_report` plugin.

### Unified Official Trade Flows Dataset

UNSD Tariff line and Eurostat datasets are ready to be merged
together. Thus, the resulting table has all the countries
worldwide.

### Standardization, editing and outlier detection

#### Unit Values computation {-}

For each record having both quantity and value (thus excluding all
commodity reported just as value), the unit value ($uv$) is
computed as following:

$$uv = \frac{value}{quantity}$$

#### Missing Quantities Imputation {-}

For records where the commodity has to be reported in quantity
and the quantity is missing and the value is present, the
corresponding quantity is imputed dividing the corresponding value
by a median unit value:

$$quantity = \frac{value}{uv_{median}}$$

The median unit value ($uv_{median}$) is obtained in a
specific-to-generic fashion (in all cases, the unit values are
calculated separately for imports and exports). A first attempt is
done by calculating unit values at the most specific HS level
(i.e., the one at which the quantity is expressed). If the number
of partners for which this unit value can be calculated is greater
than a certain threshold (currently 10) the median unit value
across partner is calculated and used for imputation. If the first
attempt fails (i.e., it is not possible to calculate a unit value
at the most specific HS level), then the same approach is used by
taking into account more generic HS levels, in particular at eight
and six digits, and the most generic level for which a sufficient
number of partners (at least 10) is available is used for
calculating the median unit value. Usually a suitable median can
be calculated at the 8-digit level or, at least, at the 6-digit
level. However, if the previous strategies fail (which implies
that there is not a sufficient number of partners in order to
calculate the median) two attempts at calculating a non
reporter-specific median unit values (i.e., median unit values
valid for all reporters) are sequentially undertaken: by HS and by
FCL. In most cases it should be possible to calculate the median
unit value by HS, thus that the FCL level is used as the strategy
of last resort.  Actually, for completeness sake, the very last
*fallback* is the median unit value by flow. This is the most
generic unit value that can be used for imputation and is
calculated just for precaution, as it is very unlikely that an
appropriate more specific median unit value can not be calculated.

In short, the first one of the following median unit values that
can be calculated is used for imputation (import and export unit
values are always calculated separately):

1. most specific HS code, across partners;
1. 8-digit HS level, across partners;
1. 6-digit HS level, across partners;
1. most specific HS code, across reporters/partners;
1. FCL code of the most specific HS code, across
   reporters/partners;
1. by flow (without taking into account any commodity code; this is
   very unlikely to be applied).

#### Outlier Detection and Imputation {-}

In the current version of the module, **no automatic outlier
imputation is carried out**. The reason is that by comparing the
results of the module by correcting outliers and previous FAOSTAT
data, the two different datasets presented remarkable differences.
Indeed, it was found that the *uncorrected* data was on average more
similar to previous FAOSTAT data. For this reason, **automatic**
correction is not currently being used, relying on a semi-automatic
(guided) correction workflow that is done through an external
validation tool. The steps of the guided validation are the
following:

1. a validation plugin for total trade is used that indicates
   which `reporter / commodity / flow / year` combination is
   likely to be an outlier. It computes various outlier detection
   routines on the data and assigns scores based on how many times
   a transaction has been found to be an outlier. This information
   is displayed on SWS by increasing levels of colouring that go
   from pale yellow to red, the last one being the one that
   indicates that a particular transaction has been found to be an
   outlier by all methods.
1. analysts select the series with outliers (by going from the
   most to the least severe cases) and use an interactive
   validation tool that allows to dig into the composition of
   total trade flows as it uses bilateral data. The tool displays
   the outliers, allows to use different methods for correcting
   them, and stores the correction that the analyst deemed
   required in a `corrections` dataset that is integrated into
   subsequent runs of the `complete_tf_cpc` trade module. In order
   to have more information on this topic, please see the
   validation tool documentation.

When no statistical-based imputation seems appropriate, analysts
can "force" some values (e.g., obtained by consulting external
sources) by overwriting the values saved on SWS and using "protected"
flags. When the modules are run, these protected figures will not
be overwritten by any figure generated by the module. The list of
protected flags is shown in the following table ("BLANK" stands for
an empty flag).

```{r}
knitr::kable(examples$protected, row.names = FALSE, caption =
'Protected flags')
```

The previous set of flags is a subset of the protected flags in
`faoswsFlag::flagValidTable`. The difference is that as trade is
concerned, the **(BLANK, c)**, **(BLANK, h)**, and **(T, c)** are
flags actually given by the module, thus they should not be
considered protected.

### Mirroring

The module generates the list of non-reporting countries: these are
the countries present as partners but missing as reporters. For
these countries the mirroring routine is applied: the
corresponding trade of the non-reporting countries are extracted
from the partners, inverting the flows. The quantities are the same
while the values are corrected by a factor of 12% due to the
CIF/FOB (Cost, Insurance and Freight / Free on Board) conversion
(i.e., original imports are divided by 1.12, while original
exports are multiplied by 1.12).

There is also another condition for which mirroring is applied:
when a flow is completely missing for a country when it is a
reporter. For instance, if in a given year Tanzania did not report
any flow as export, but did so for imports, the mirroring
procedure will be used for exports.

## Flags

The module assigns two types of flags ("Observation Status" and
"Method") once some conditions are met.

The first flags that all data are given are a "BLANK" Observation
Status flag and an "h" Method flag. They indicate that data are
official and were harvested, respectively. After these, the
different kind of flags, and the conditions that should be met in
order to assign them, are reported in the document "Flag
Management in the Trade module".

An observation can have multiple Observation Status flags and
Method flags associated with it. The final flag is the "weakest"
flag: the `flagWeightTable` table contains the weights that should
be assigned to all flags, and the one with the lowest value
prevails over the other flags. For instance, if two official
transactions at the HS level are aggregated in one CPC code, then
the "s" (for aggregation) Method flag will prevail over the two
"h" (for harvested) Method flags of each transaction.

## Conversion to FAO SWS standards

At this point data is almost ready to be saved in the SWS.
Additional mapping and aggregation are necessary in order to
respect the SWS standards:

- Conversion of FCL into CPC codes. This conversion is based on
  the table of conversion 2.1 expanded. If some FCL codes are not
  mapped to CPC, the corresponding records are filtered
  out. Since the mapping between FCL and CPC is one-to-one there
  is no aggregation at this point. The routine just adds the
  corresponding CPC code.

- Conversion from FAO country code to M49.

- Each row of the final output must be either quantity- or
  value-specific, while so far the module keeps this information
  in one row. The information is therefore split in two separate
  rows.

The first submodule saves the final output in the
`completed_tf_cpc_m49` dataset, within the `trade` domain.

## Use validation corrections

If corrections for the year for which the module is run exits,
they will replace the data generated by the module. For instance,
if the module generated 2 million tonnes for some item in some
country, but in the validation process it was found that this figure
suffers from an "order of magnitude" problem, because it was saved
as tonnes while it should have actually be kilograms so that it got
replaced by 2 thousand tonnes, 2 millions will be replaced by
2 thousand in the data that is processed. When values are replaced
by validated figures, they get the **(I, e)** flags combination.
Moreover, if a mirror flow exists it will be changed accordingly
(in this case, the flags combination will be set to **(T, e)**).

The "corrections" mechanism was designed so that if the original
figure that will be replaced is different from what the analyst
corrected, the correction will be dropped. This can happen for
different reasons, among which: raw data changed and pre-existing
errors were corrected; the mapping table of a commodity was modified;
etc.

Metadata for corrected figures is generated and will be saved on SWS.

## Remove non-existent transactions

The module checks whether there are combinations of `reporter` /
`partner` / `item` / `element` stored on SWS that is not generated
by the module. If there is any, said combination(s) will be removed
from SWS. Indeed, the module should generate all possible combinations
of those dimensions and combinations that are not generated should
not exist. These "non-existing" combinations can be present on SWS
because they were generated in the past but they should not have been.
Also in this case, possible reasons can be multiple: the module had a
bug that got corrected; the mapping table was modified; etc. Given
that the SWS R-API does not have an option to check whether some
combinations are not going to be overwritten, this needs to be done
code-side by performing a set difference on the combinations available
in the module and those generated by the module. Values and flags of
the resulting combinations will be set to NA as there is actually no
way to remove the observation. In any case result is substantially the
same.

# Total trade CPC

This second submodule uses as input the output of the previous
submodule. It aggregates total trade flows by reporting country
for partners countries to a single total trade for each unique CPC
commodity code. As the previous one, this submodule works by year.

The module saves the output into the dataset `total_trade_cpc_m49`,
within the `trade` domain.

As for the `complete_tf_cpc`, non-existent transactions are removed.
In this case, the combinations to compare are composed by `reporter` /
`item` / `element`.

# Flow Chart Process

The whole process is displayed in the next flow chart.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/trade_1.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/trade_2.png")
```

# Future work

## Outlier identification/imputation at the bilateral level

Outliers were identified in a previous version of the
`complete_tf_cpc` module and imputed automatically by using the
median unit value with a specific-to-generic median unit value
calculation, as explained above. Results were found to be
unsatisfactory, thus automatic imputation was switched off. Said
strategy could be supplemented by using information of neighbour
or similar countries (e.g., the median unit value of Asian
countries for a detailed HS level can be used for imputing an
outlier for an Asian country instead of going up to the HS8 or HS6
level for the country itself as attempted in the
specific-to-generic approach).

## Destination Table

The `complete_tf_cpc` module produces output for all the records
passing all the routines and not filtered out. The module does not
check if any commodity is missing. A possible solution would be to
have a destination table with all the commodities of interest and
the module should fill the destination table. In this way the
output validation step should be achieved.

## CIF/FOB

The CIF/FOB correction for mirroring is, at the time being, set up
to 12%. This has been suggested by team B/C.  Additional work
might be done in order to assess if this estimate is appropriate,
but logic suggests that this is a very crude approximation.
Indeed, there are different range of percentages for different
type of countries and by distance between reporters and partners
(e.g., the cost of transportation of a given commodity is
definitely different if it is between France and Italy or France
and Australia). A study can be conducted on available records on
both sides: this means records for which the commodity is reported
by the reporter and by the partner.

## Re-import and Re-export

All re-imports and re-exports are considered as, respectively,
imports and exports. More study might be conducted in order to
identify countries more prone to report re-imports and re-exports.

## Self Trade Analysis

- A script within the vignette folder, named selftrade.R, has been
  used to perform some simple analyses on the self trade. The
  script filter all records for which the reporter and the partner
  are the same. The script compute the sum of all value across all
  commodities per country (Figure 1), or the sum of all the value
  for each commodity across all countries (Figure 2). In this way
  we can spot out the countries reporting massive self trade as
  well as which are the main commodities reported in self trade.

  This is an example of the graphical output (still part of the
  script).

  ![Sum of all self trade records by country.](../selftrade_by_country_name.pdf)

  ![Sum of all self trade records by commodity. Codes in FCL.](../selftrade_by_commodity_code.pdf)

- This might be incorporated in the module and might produce
  suitable output within the SWS. More documentation is needed.

## Pseudo-automatic mapping of commodities

An additional method could be added in the future: the algorithm
should try to trim the code not mapped and try to map them with
shorter HS codes. If any of shorter codes (from right to left) are
then not mapped, we can definitely discard the record. If a
specific record has a HS code not mapping to any specific FCL
code, then the record is reported and removed.

## Mapping from HS to FCL/CPC

In the module for commodities we have two different mappings. From
HS to FCL, using a mapping table produced by team B/C and then
from FCL to CPC 2.1. In the future direct mapping from HS to CPC
has been asked from management. A possible solution, where adding
the column with the one-to-one CPC codes has been sent to Carola
(09.06.2016), but anyway this needs revision
([link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Z6srBtmyJRUmtaaXphTllZUDA))

## Mapping from Comtrade M49 and Geonomenclature directly to M49

The country codes, as the commodity ones, have two steps of
mapping. This results in higher risk of data loss due to unsolved
mapping. A direct map from Comtrade M49 (Tariff line UNSD) to M49
and from Geonomenclature (Eurostat) to M49 would be ideal.

## Food-aid

This has to be incorporated also to understand the trend in a time
series analysis. This needs special study to understand if we can
get the data just from the exports not reported as imports in the
partner.
